            "Paste your JD here: We are seeking an experienced Oracle PL/SQL Developer to join our dynamic team in Toronto, ON. As a key member of our organization, you will play a critical role in developing, maintaining, and optimizing database solutions for large-scale applications in finance, insurance, and data analytics. The ideal candidate will have a proven track record of working with Oracle databases, creating efficient PL/SQL scripts, and managing data in compliance with industry standards. This is a full-time position that offers an opportunity to collaborate with cross-functional teams to implement innovative database solutions that meet complex business requirements.  In this role, you will be responsible for designing, testing, and maintaining PL/SQL stored procedures, functions, packages, and triggers to support business applications. You will optimize database queries using advanced techniques such as bulk collections, cursor management, and table partitioning to ensure efficient data handling. Additional responsibilities include performing data migrations and ETL processes using tools like SQL*Loader, Data Pump, and external tables. You will analyze and resolve performance bottlenecks using query optimization techniques and tools such as AWR and ADDM while ensuring compliance with data protection standards like GDPR. Your contributions will also involve collaborating with global teams to gather requirements, document technical designs, and implement solutions that align with business goals.  The successful candidate will have at least six years of experience as an Oracle PL/SQL Developer, with expertise in Oracle 11g/12c, tools such as SQL Developer and TOAD, and a strong knowledge of data modeling and normalization techniques. You should have hands-on experience with ETL processes, partitioned tables, bitmap indexes, and collections (nested tables, VARRAYs, associative arrays). Familiarity with Agile methodologies, tools like JIRA, and DevOps practices such as Git and Jenkins is essential. Excellent problem-solving, debugging, and performance-tuning skills are critical for success in this role.  While not required, experience in the financial or insurance sectors, exposure to front-end technologies (HTML, PHP, JavaScript), and knowledge of data warehousing tools such as Informatica would be an asset. Additionally, certifications like Oracle Certified Associate (OCA) in PL/SQL and advanced database certifications will strengthen your candidacy.  In return, we offer a competitive salary, performance-based bonuses, and a comprehensive benefits package that includes health, dental, and retirement plans. You will have access to professional development opportunities, certification reimbursements, and flexible work schedules with hybrid/remote options. As part of a collaborative and innovative team, you will work on impactful projects that challenge your expertise and contribute to the success of global clients.  Join us and take your career to the next level as we deliver cutting-edge database solutions and empower businesses to thrive in a fast-paced digital world.\n"
